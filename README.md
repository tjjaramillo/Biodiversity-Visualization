# Plotly-Challenge

For this project I built an interactive dashboard to explore a biodiversity dataset which catalogued microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people while the rest were relatively rare.
