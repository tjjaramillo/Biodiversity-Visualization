# Plotly-Challenge

[Click here](https://tjjaramillo.github.io/Plotly-Challenge/) to view my interactive dashboard web page. This dashboard was created utilizing Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, and Plotly.

For this project I built an interactive dashboard to explore a biodiversity dataset which catalogued microbes that human navels. The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people while the rest were relatively rare.
