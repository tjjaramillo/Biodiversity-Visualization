# Visualization of Biodiversity

![Header Image](Images/bacteria_image.jpg)

For this project I built an interactive dashboard to explore a biodiversity dataset which catalogued microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people while the rest were relatively rare.

Using JSON data I created a dropdown menu to select specific patient numbers to reveal the bacterial composition of the sample obtained from each subject as well as display patient information.

Created a barchart displaying the top 10 OTU's found in each subject selected by the dropdown menu along with a Guage Chart displaying the subjects' weekly washing frequency.

Lastly, created a bubble chart that displays each cample for the selected subject.
